<h1>About Me</h1>

<p align="justify">I am glad that I have piqued your interest and that you want to know more about me. My favorite quote is <bold>“Live simple, think higher”</bold>. That should speak volumes about the kind of person I am; A silent observer of everything that happens around me, accumulating collective knowledge, gathering skills and experiences, changing and transforming myself continuously (basically an Introvert), so that one day I can make a contribution to the world, to make it a better place.</p>

<h3>Long story short . . .</h3>

<p align="justify">I am an Electrical Engineering graduate. I work as a Junior Engineer in Wolfram Research Inc., at Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India. My hometown is Pondicherry, India (Yes, I prefer calling it Pondicherry, the way it is meant to be called, rather than Puducherry).</p>

<p align="justify">I love to play music. I have taught myself to play the Keyboard, Guitar and Violin. I also love to read books. I spend most of my free time doing either of these two activities. When extremely bored, I like to code as well. I like creating puzzles and solve math questions very much.<p>

<p align="justify">I am a very organized person and like to keep my place neat and clean. After all <bold>“Cleanliness is next to Godliness”</bold>. However, at the same time, I am very open minded and free spirited. Everyday I drive myself to learn something new and explore something that is unexplored.</p>
