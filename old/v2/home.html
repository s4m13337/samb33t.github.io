Welcome to my personal website. This website contains the nexus of everything about me.

Initially when I purchased this domain, I merely thought of having a website to post some stories occasionally. I started out with Wordpress. I saw a lot of posts on the internet that praised the power of Wordpress and illustrated how easy it is create and maintain a powerful website with it. I gave it a shot. But one month down the road, I realized that it's learning curve is actually limited. I was not happy with it. I am a person who likes to learn new things everyday. Learning is something that never ends and the process walks with us to our grave. Thus I decided to remove Wordpress and I started writing this website completely out of scratch.

It has been an arduous task so far. But then, I am learning something new (or maybe old) all the time and that is what keeps me going on. It has taken me roughly about 2 weeks to recall my high-school HTML lessons, in addition to learning CSS, Javascript and PHP to finally produce this basic website. As I learn more, I will be tweaking it more and making it more versatile. So, this is another addition to my list of diverse hobbies.

As soon I am done with some more basic pending design related work, I will start making posts for Technology and Personal stories.
