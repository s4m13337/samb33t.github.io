	<p>Hi! Welcome to my personal website. I have written this website with plain HTML, some CSS sprinkled here and there and absolutely no JS! My point is that JS is meant to be used for complex applications that require several levels of logic and this website requires none of it. It is just here to display static content that I write down. The philosophy that goes into any of my designs is:</p>

	<blockquote>
	 <em>"A good design is as little design as possible"</em>
	</blockquote>

	<h1>History</h1>

	<p>To be completely honest, This minimalist design was never in my mind. The idea has sort of evolved over the years as I explored the deepest corners of this rabbit hole called web-designing. I purchased my first domain in 2019 and like every other newbie out there I installed wordpress and started wrtiting. A few articles later, I started to realize that I don't have the much needed control that I always seek, over the wordpress ecosystem. I started researching other content management systems. It turns out that there are plenty out there, some being more popular than the others and in every case, the control gets limited after certain extent</p>

	<p>Buckle up! About this time, I decided to learn PHP and design my own personal content management system. Learning PHP came with its own challenges as I had to learn about Databases and SQL as well. It seemed overwhelming at first but nevertheless, I learned it at my own pace and successfully designed my own CMS. There were instances where I would feel like reinventing the wheel but then I would remind myself that by reinventing the wheel, one also encounters the intricacies involved and this may come handy later on.</p>

	<p>Moving forward, I decided to move from a shared hosting platform to a VPS. This unlocked a plethora of unexplored territories in the world of backend management. With a VPS, I was now not only hosting my website, but I had also set up my private XMPP chat server, a private VoIP and a my own VPN server too! But then sadly, one day, my subscription expired and at this time I took a moment to re-evaluate everything. <em>All I ever wanted was to host a website where I write whatever I want...</em> And this got me to lean towards the direction of this minimalist design.</p>

	<p>At some point in time during those years, I pledged to become a digital minimalist (more on this in  a blog post soon), essentially getting rid of all the distracting an unwanted technologies and keeping only the ones that are absolutely necessary. I thought of applying the same philosophy to my website: Strip down everything and keep only the bare essentials. I turned to Static site generators initally. I tried out Jekyll for a time, but soon realized that it was bloated as well. I finally gave up searching for the perfect one-fits-all framework and decided to write my webiste, the "Chad" way of writing any code: Using plain HTML and CSS!</p>

	<p>So In summary, I now write my content in pure HTML. I use Emacs to write everything (Yes, Emacs is way better than Vim!) and don't use any auto-completion tools like Emmet or any Linter to properly organize my code. I do everything by myself. This is my website and this is the true way to own it.<p/>
